# Scenario Provision Tool

> **WARNING:** the script is currently under development. Some configurations might not work as expected. **Do not test on production environments.**

## Config.sh tooling

```
./config.sh consul_server_config --interface=eno1 --consul-datacenter=dc1 --consul-retry-join=[172.16.8.3,172.16.8.2]
```

## Test scenarios

Using the pre-configured environments you can spin-up scenarios to be used in
tutorials or as test environments.

### Available environments

The environments are defined inside the `./self-managed/infrastructure/aws/conf` 
folder:

```
tree ./self-managed/infrastructure/aws/conf
```

```
./self-managed/infrastructure/aws/conf
├── 00_hashicups.tfvars
├── 01_consul.tfvars
├── 02_service_discovery.tfvars
├── 03_service_mesh.tfvars
├── 04_service_mesh_access.tfvars
└── 05_service_mesh_monitoring.tfvars

0 directories, 6 files
```

### Spin-up environment

> **Info:** only AWS cloud provider scenarios are available ATM.

Use one of the configurations available as parameter for `terraform`:

```
cd ./infrastructure/aws
```

First, initialize the Terraform project.

```
terraform init
```

Optionally, reset your environment.

```
terraform destroy --auto-approve && \
    terraform apply --auto-approve -var-file=./conf/00_hashicups.tfvars
```

### Scenario Output

> **Info:** the tool is currently under active development, the info in this section 
might be outdated. Refer to the actual output of your `terraform apply` command.

```
terraform output
```

```plaintext
connection_string = "ssh -i certs/id_rsa.pem admin@`terraform output -raw ip_bastion`"
ip_bastion = "35.161.114.102"
remote_ops = "export BASTION_HOST=35.161.114.102"
retry_join = "provider=aws tag_key=ConsulJoinTag tag_value=auto-join-j26f"
ui_consul = "https://35.87.2.143:8443"
ui_grafana = "http://35.161.114.102:3000"
ui_hashicups = "http://34.216.72.145"
```

* `connection_string`: is the command you can use to connect via SSH to the 
Bastion Host. By changing the `ip_bastion` to one of the `ip_*` output names you
can connect to the respective host.

* `ip_bastion`: Public IP of the *Bastion Host*. This is a VM containing all 
necessary tools to interact with the environment. The tool uses this host as a 
entrypoint into the environment and as a centralized scenario orchestrator. Read 
more on [Bastion Host](./docs/BastionHost.md).

* `ip_*`: Public IP of the `*` host. Used for UI and SSH connections.

* `ui_consul`: UI for Consul Control Plane. Some scenario do not start Consul
servers or do not deploy an HCP Consul cluster. In those scenarios the URL will 
not work or might be empty. This is expected for those scenarios that test the
Consul daemon lifecycle.

* `ui_hashicups`: UI for the Grafana monitoring tool. The tool is running from
the Bastion Host VM.

* `ui_hashicups`: UI for the test application, HashiCups, deployed in all 
scenarios. For most scenarios the UI corresponds to the `nginx` host.

## The demo application

All the scenarios include a demo application, *HashiCups*, used to demonstrate 
Consul features in a setting that can mimic real-life deployments.

Read more in the [HashiCups Demo Application](./docs/HashiCups.md) page.

## Scenarios

## Separate scripts

During the environment setup, some steps of the UX are performed using external scripts. 
Those steps are usually the operations more dependent on your specific deployment.

We detached those steps into supporting scripts to:
* provide easier reference for those steps
* avoid code drift for the core parts of the workflow

The scripts are located under the `./ops/scenarios/99_supporting_scripts/` folder:

```
tree ./ops/scenarios/99_supporting_scripts/
./ops/scenarios/99_supporting_scripts/
├── generate_consul_client_config.sh
├── generate_consul_server_config.sh
├── generate_consul_server_tokens.sh
└── generate_consul_service_config.sh

0 directories, 4 files

```

You can use the scripts in this folder as a source of inspiration for writing your custom configuration scripts.

Read more on the different scripts on the [Separate Scripts](./docs/SeparateScripts.md) page.
